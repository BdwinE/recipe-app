# Recipe-App

This is a recipe book application built using Angular, showcasing my skills in frontend development. The App allows users to browse and manage recipes with ease.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.3.

## Key Features 

### Authentication 

Sign up, log in, and log out.

### Recipes

Create, delete and update recipes.

### Shopping List

Add, remove or update ingredients from the shopping list. Can also add ingredients straight from a recipe.

### Storage

Save and fetch recipes from a firebase database.

## Development server

The app is hosted [here](https://recipe-app-project-98dbb.web.app/auth) so you can see how it works without running it on a development server.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
